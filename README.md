#### How to use this repository?

Users can download a zip file of the entire repository by clicking on the green code tab at the top of the page and then clicking Download ZIP. Users who already have a GitHub account can fork the repository.

The key file in this repository is the ðŸ“„ ms.qmd. This file can be rendered in R with Quarto to reproduce the entire paper. Code chunks within the file provide the code used to reproduce figures and analyses along with supporting statements within the text. Note that inline code chunks use specific objects which are then rendered. Models will need to be run by changin refit to TRUE.

The ðŸ“„ ms.qmd file makes use of files within a number of folders that are identified in the code chunks. There are a number of important folders in the repository.

  ðŸ“‚ data folder contains all the raw data used in files. Note that there are different files. In output/database_clean there are the main files employed in the analyses and figures.   
  ðŸ“‚ output/figs/ Folder contains all the figures for the paper that are read and included in the paper.   
  ðŸ“‚ R folder contains three files, two of them used to clean and process data to prepare it for use in the ms.qmd file. Note that readers do not need to open and run these files, but they are simply here to document the workflow and code used to clean up data to be used. These include:  
        ðŸ“„ 1_data_process.R, which is used to produce the files in output/database_clean from the raw data in data folder.  
        ðŸ“„ func.R, which contains all the functions called later in the ms.qmd file.   
  ðŸ“‚ bib The bib folder contains:  
        ðŸ“„ refs.bib the references;  
        ðŸ“„ proceedings-of-the-royal-society-b.csl the journal formatting style file;  
        ðŸ“„ template.docx a template docx file to format the resulting rendered files.  
  ðŸ“‚ PROCB This folder contains all the material submitted to the journal, plus all the material from the reviews.
